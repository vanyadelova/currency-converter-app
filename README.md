# ðŸ’±  Currency Converter App ðŸ’±  

## What this project is about
This is my own attempt at the Glomo's coding challenge. I was expected to develop a Sports Poll app (using React JS). The app should include the following features:

- **Tests**
- **Readme**
- **Working code**
- **Nice commit messages**
- **There should be one poll at a time**
- **Users are allowed to vote on each event**
- **The polling options should be what team will win or if it will be a draw**


## Run it locally ðŸ–¥

Clone the repository.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/vanyadelova/SportsPoll.git

Install project dependencies and start the app.

```
cd SportsPoll
yarn
